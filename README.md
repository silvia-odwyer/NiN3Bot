# NiN3Bot
Pronounced "NineBot" 
A very, very basic Discord bot, created using the knowledge I've learned from the Go Mentorship program. (Danke, Noah)
In short, NiN3Bot likes to get random numbers and select certain items based on those numbers. /s

## Commands 
`9art`	-> Gets a random piece of one-line ASCII art. 

`9font`		-> Converts plaintext to a cool ⒸⒾⓇⒸⓊⓁⒶⓇ font (More fonts coming soon!)

`9img`	-> Generates a pattern based on a random string generated by NiN3Bot (all thanks to the Geopattern Go Library) NOTE: Still doesn't function yet, need to embed the SVG somehow

`9time`	-> Yep, you guessed it, NiN3Bot gets the time, based on your timezone (hopefully).

`9repeat`		-> Repeat after me, NiN3Bot.

`9sayhi`    -> NiN3Bot strives to be a friendly bot, so it'll say hi.

## Developments Coming Soon
- More fonts will be added.
- Random Unicode font generator 
- Embed SVGs somehow :thinking:
- . . . and other things that are still unplanned but may be on the way.

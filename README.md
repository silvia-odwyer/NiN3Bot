# NiN3Bot
(Pronounced "NineBot")

A basic Discord bot, created using the knowledge I've learned from UCC Netsoc's Go Mentorship program.

Danke, @Strum355 :')

## What Can NiN3Bot Do?
In short, NiN3Bot likes to get random numbers and select certain items based on those numbers. /s
That's as far as I've gotten with it thus far.

## Commands 

### How To Use The `9font` Command
`9font c`		-> Converts plaintext to a cool ⒸⒾⓇⒸⓊⓁⒶⓇ font (More fonts coming soon!)

`9font m`		-> Converts plaintext to a monospaced font

`9font t`		-> Converts plaintext to a traditional, old-style font

Example: 
`9font m Hello there` prints "Hello there" in a monospaced font.

### Other Commands
`9art`	-> Gets a random piece of one-line ASCII art. 

`9img`	-> Generates a pattern based on a random string generated by NiN3Bot (all thanks to the Geopattern Go Library) NOTE: Still doesn't function yet, need to embed the SVG somehow

`9time`	-> Yep, you guessed it, NiN3Bot gets the time, based on your timezone (hopefully).

`9repeat`		-> Repeat after me, NiN3Bot.

`9sayhi`    -> NiN3Bot strives to be a friendly bot, so it'll say hi.

## Developments Coming Soon
- More fonts will be added to the 9font command.
- Might add a random Unicode font generator, so that all sorts of strange yet quirky messages can be generated.
- Embed SVGs somehow `:thinking:`
- . . . and other things that are still unplanned but may be on the way.
